- ðŸ‘€ My main field of intrest and study is Cosmology in particular the several possible cosmological tests that can be performed through the study of Gravitational Lensing, both strong and weak.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my master thesis on the detection of Clusters of Galaxies throuh the effect of weak lensing in the background galaxies. Currently working on a code (GtH21 by Panebianco, Maturi and Giocoli) based on the application of an "optimal filter" both to simulated EUCLID data and KiDS real data. I'm training my skills in C++, python and bash coding besides using softwares like DS9 and Topcat.
