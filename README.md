- Hi everyone, I'm Leonardo Trobbiani (@LeoTrobbiani), I'm a PhD student in Astrophysics at the University of Bologna and Institute of Radioastronomy (INAF-IRA).
- ðŸ‘€ My main field of interest and study is Galaxy formation and Cosmology. I'm specifically interested in using the gravitational lensing phenomena, both strong and weak, as a powerful tool to investigate Cosmological models involving dark matter and dark energy and also galaxy formation and evolution. 
- ðŸŒ± In my PhD project I'm working with Matteo Bonato and Ivano Baronchelli on a systematic search for ultra-bright high-z strongly lensed galaxies in Planck catalogues. Currently, I'm analysing ATCA data to extract the candidate sources.
- ðŸŒ± I worked on my master's thesis on the detection of Clusters of Galaxies through the effect of weak lensing in the background galaxies. I developed AMICO-WL, an extension of AMICO (Bellgamba and Maturi) for the application of the "matched optimal filter" technique on Weak Lensing data from wide-field surveys like EUCLID. A paper is in preparation while the code is also participating in an internal EUCLID challenge. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: my e-mail address at the University of Bologna: is leonardo.trobbiani2@unibo.it and leonardo.trobbiani@studio.unibo.it; and my institutional e-mail address at the IRA is leonardo.trobbiani@inaf.it
